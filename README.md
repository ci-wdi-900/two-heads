# Cheat Off Each Other

### Or: Two Heads Bashed Together

---

### Introduction

We'll be improving our `BASH` cheat-sheeting today, putting our best foot forward out of four possible feet--that is, you'll be working in pairs! We'll consolidate those pairs of cheat-sheets into one master cheat-sheet, adding some extra info, deciding on the best wording and format, and making it _pretty_.

Or, at least, as pretty as Markdown will allow.


### Goals

* Work on our collaboration skills.
* Get a bit more practice with Markdown.
* Get a LOT more practice with `git`.


### Setup

* Create a new repository on GitHub. Make sure to check the box to initialize the repo with a README!
* Add your collaborator as an official collaborator.
* One of you will "drive" and one of you will "navigate", and you will switch halfway through (or more often than that if you want practice with `push` and `pull`).
* When you switch, run a `git push` (with an `add` and `commit` first, of course), then your partner will do a `git pull`.


### Guidelines

* Work on the file one at a time, and switch which person is "driving" _at least_ once.
* Include as much information as you reasonably can on each `BASH` command.
* A poor collaborator is a poor developer, so... Don't Be A Jerk. Listen to your partner and find a plan you can both be proud of.


### Stretch Goals

* Include information on as many flags as you can. Showing all files with `ls`, making parent directories with `mkdir`, and removing directories with `rm` are all things you should know or learn, and there are other interesting and useful flags out there. Check them out!
